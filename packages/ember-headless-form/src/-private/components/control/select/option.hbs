Ember seems to insist to set `selected` as a property instead of an attribute.
But an attribute is needed if you want to use this with SSR/FastBoot, so the selected option is preselected before JS has loaded.
Using this wonky workaround for now.

{{#if this.isSelected}}
  <option value={{@value}} selected ...attributes>{{yield}}</option>
{{else}}
  <option value={{@value}} ...attributes>{{yield}}</option>
{{/if}}
